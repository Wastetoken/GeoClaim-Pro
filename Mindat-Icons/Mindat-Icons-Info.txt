The small symbol inside of an icon describes the class of locality listed. This can be combined with the three base icon colours (red, green, white) in any combination.

Red icons have coordinates entered into the system directly.

Green icons have coordinates estimated by the system and may also display a blue margin of error circle around them. 

White icons are shown in certain pages to distinguish the locality in question from nearby localities. 

When multiple icons are close together they may be clustered into a group represented by a green circle, click to reveal the contents.
